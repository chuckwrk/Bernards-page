		As you can see, Bernard is a white/brown small dog. His breed is a mix of two with I think would be terrier and something else.
		I'm not very sure... I just love him alot!
		<br>
		<br>
		Bernard is about 5 1/2 years old. He was born from a litter of 5 puppies on November of 2016! He is strong, fast, and likes to eat burgers.
